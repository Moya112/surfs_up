# Climate Analysis to invest in surf shop

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the weather before investing in a surfing shop on Oahu Island. To do this, we use the SQLite weather database. The project also uses SQLAlchemy create_engine to connect the SQLite database and automap_base() to reflect tables into classes and save a reference. To determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round, We want temperature data for June and December in Oahu.

## Results
